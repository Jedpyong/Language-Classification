Versatula is a fun game of languages which is fully dependent on machine learning.
This is a machine learning project developed in compliance to Intelligent Systems subject of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the Visayas State University - Main Campus

How to use?

-Use this c# program mainly for user interaction through UI.

-To run the program, the saved model must be connected to the c# program mentioned in visual studios 2022 through flask API which will be accessible in this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qd6DIAJkchy7lruZeDR7yJQ3pfBiodeC?usp=drive_link.

-After running the flask API, copy the server URL provided then change the server URL used in the LanguagePredictor.cs file in visual studios 2022.

NOTE: This app was not fully deployed since in this subject, we are more focused on machine learning process such as gathering and preprocessing data, and training machine learning models while experimenting on different approaches such as CNN, FFNN, Naive Bayes etc. which greatly consumed much of our limited time.
